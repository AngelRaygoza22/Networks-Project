    <h2>Lincoln Memorial</h2>
    <p>The Lincoln Memorial was built to honor President Abraham Lincoln, who was the 16th President of the United States. 
      It's a tribute to his leadership during the American Civil War. 
      Inside the memorial, there's a giant statue of Lincoln, and above it, you'll find the words "In this temple as in the 
      hearts of the people for whom he saved the union the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever." 
      The memorial's construction started in 1914 and was finally dedicated in 1922. It was designed by architect Henry Bacon, 
      who also sculpted the statue of Lincoln inside. It's not just a memorial, though. It's been the site of important speeches 
      and events, like Martin Luther King's famous "I have a dream" speech in 1963. Today, the Lincoln Memorial is a majestic part 
      of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. It's overseen by the National Parks Service and surrounded by other historical sites. 
      You can visit the memorial anytime, but it can get pretty crowded. If you want a quieter experience, try going at night when it's illuminated.</p>
