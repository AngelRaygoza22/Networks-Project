    <h2>Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park</h2>
    <p>The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Park covers about 35 acres and includes several sites in Atlanta, Georgia related to the life and work of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. who believed in peaceful protests and making things right for everyone. It is an incredibly significant place for Civil Rights Movement, when people were fighting for equality and justice. One interesting fact  about the park is that it has Dr. King's childhood home. The park also has other important places, like the church where he and his dad were pastors. It's called Ebenezer Baptist Church. There's the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, started by his wife, Coretta Scott King. It's a place where you can learn since there are exhibits and tours that teach you all about Dr. King's life and the Civil Rights Movement. It's a celebration of African American culture and heritage. It's all about recognizing the contributions of people who fought for civil rights and made a difference. It's a way to remember and honor Dr. King's legacy and reminds us that we all have a role to play in making the world a better place.
